# Computer Vision with Red Language 
## see http://www.red-lang.org 
### This library needs View 


Only for Windows for the moment. Avaialable for OSX and Linux ASAP



### NEW: June 2016
After playing a long with OpenCV and Red languge, it's time for me to write some image processing functions directly with Red:)

Conversions, logical and some math operators for images are available.


According to KISS spirit of Red, you only need  to include one file in your code : #include %libs/redcv.red.(See opimage.red sample for detail).

This file includes Red Functions and calls all necessary routines. 

More functions and samples to come!

You'll find some images to play with in images dir. All supported images by Red can be used.

Special thanks to Nenad for developing Red, and to Qingtian for image implementation.


##Please feel free to contribute and enjoy :)
